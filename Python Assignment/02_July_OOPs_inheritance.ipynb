    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (called the \"subclass\" or \"derived class\") to inherit attributes and behaviors (i.e., fields and methods) from an existing class (called the \"superclass\" or \"base class\"). Inheritance creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, where the subclass is considered a specialized version of the superclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"https://image.slidesharecdn.com/inheritance-170223061721/95/object-oriented-programming-inheritance-2-1024.jpg?cb=1487830725\" >\n",
    "Here's why inheritance is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code Reusability:** Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing you to define common attributes and methods in a base class. Subclasses can then inherit and reuse these elements without the need to rewrite them. This reduces redundancy and makes code more efficient and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specialization:** Inheritance allows you to create more specialized classes that inherit the characteristics of a more general class. This is particularly useful for modeling real-world entities where objects can be categorized hierarchically. For example, you might have a general \"Vehicle\" class and specialized subclasses like \"Car,\" \"Truck,\" and \"Motorcycle.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extensibility:** You can extend the functionality of a class by adding new attributes and methods in the subclass. This allows you to build upon the existing behavior of the superclass and adapt it to specific requirements. Inheritance provides a mechanism for incremental development.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism:** Inheritance is closely related to polymorphism, another important OOP concept. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This is beneficial for creating generic code that can work with various subclasses interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Organization:** Inheritance helps organize and structure code, making it easier to manage and understand. It establishes a clear relationship between classes, making the code more intuitive and logical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful mechanism in OOP, but it should be used thoughtfully. Overuse of inheritance can lead to complex class hierarchies and code that is difficult to maintain. Therefore, it's important to strike a balance and use inheritance when it genuinely represents an \"is-a\" relationship between classes, where the subclass is a specialization of the superclass."

    "In Python, you can use both single inheritance and multiple inheritance, and they have some unique characteristics and advantages. Let's discuss these concepts in the context of Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Inheritance in Python:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Single inheritance in Python allows a class to inherit from only one superclass. This is similar to single inheritance in other programming languages.\n",
    "- **Syntax:** In Python, you define a single inheritance relationship by specifying the base class in the class definition using parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ParentClass:\n",
    "       # Parent class attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "   class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "       # Child class attributes and methods\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "   1. **Simplicity:** Single inheritance is straightforward to understand and implement, making your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "   2. **Reduced Ambiguity:** It helps avoid conflicts and ambiguity that may arise when dealing with multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multiple Inheritance in Python:**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Python allows for multiple inheritance, which means a class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple superclasses. This is one of the key features of Python's object-oriented system.\n",
    "- **Syntax:** To use multiple inheritance in Python, list all the base classes in the class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ParentClass1:\n",
    "       # Parent class 1 attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "   class ParentClass2:\n",
    "       # Parent class 2 attributes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "   class ChildClass(ParentClass1, ParentClass2):\n",
    "       # Child class attributes and methods\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "   1. **Reusability:** Multiple inheritance allows for a higher degree of code reusability. You can inherit features from multiple sources, promoting a \"mix-and-match\" approach to building classes.\n",
    "   2. **Enhanced Flexibility:** It enables you to create more complex class hierarchies and model real-world scenarios where an object exhibits traits or behaviors from multiple categories.\n",
    "   3. **Avoiding Code Duplication:** Multiple inheritance helps prevent code duplication by inheriting attributes and methods from various sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences and Considerations in Python:**\n",
    "1. **Method Resolution Order (MRO):** Python uses a method resolution order to determine the order in which methods are called in the presence of multiple inheritance. It follows the C3 Linearization algorithm, which takes care of the order in which base classes are searched when a method is invoked. This helps avoid ambiguity and conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Potential Conflicts:** With multiple inheritance, you need to be cautious about potential naming conflicts when two or more base classes define attributes or methods with the same name. It's essential to manage these conflicts explicitly in your subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diamond Problem:** Python's multiple inheritance system includes mechanisms to resolve the \"diamond problem,\" ensuring that the same base class is not included multiple times in the method resolution order. Python's approach to resolving this issue is known as C3 Linearization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you have the flexibility to choose between single and multiple inheritance, depending on your project's specific requirements. Multiple inheritance can be a powerful tool for creating complex class hierarchies and promoting code reuse, but it also requires careful consideration of potential naming conflicts and understanding of Python's MRO system.\n",

    "In the context of inheritance in Python, the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" are used to describe the relationship between classes that are involved in inheritance. Let's define these terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base Class (or Superclass):**\n",
    "- A base class, also known as a superclass, is a class that provides attributes and methods to be inherited by other classes. It serves as the foundation for creating new classes. In other words, a base class is the class from which attributes and behaviors are inherited.\n",
    "- Base classes are defined independently and can be used as templates or blueprints for creating new classes.\n",
    "- Base classes do not inherit from other classes. They are at the top of the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",

    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, `Animal` is the base class, and `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes that inherit from the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derived Class (or Subclass):**\n",
    "- A derived class, also known as a subclass, is a class that inherits attributes and methods from a base class. It extends or specializes the functionality of the base class by adding new attributes or methods or by modifying the inherited ones.\n",
    "- A derived class is created using the base class as a starting point, and it can have its own unique attributes and methods in addition to the inherited ones.\n",
    "- A derived class can inherit from only one base class in the case of single inheritance or from multiple base classes in the case of multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Woof!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def speak(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, both `Dog` and `Cat` are derived classes because they inherit attributes and methods from the `Animal` base class while adding their own `speak` method to provide a specific behavior for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the base class is the class from which attributes and behaviors are inherited, serving as a template, while the derived class is a class that inherits from the base class and extends or specializes its functionality. The relationship between them is fundamental in inheritance-based object-oriented programming and is a key concept in Python's OOP system.\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "7033b703",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In Python, the \"protected\" access modifier is not as strict as \"private\" or \"public\" access modifiers, and it is often referred to as a naming convention rather than a true access control modifier. This is because Python does not enforce access control like some other languages. Instead, it relies on conventions and naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of class members. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the \"protected\" modifier differs from \"private\" and \"public\" in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Public Access Modifier:**\n",
    "   - In Python, members with no access modifier are considered public by default. They can be accessed from anywhere, both within the class and from external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.public_var = 10\n",
    "       \n",
    "   obj = MyClass()\n",
    "   print(obj.public_var)  # Accessible from outside the class\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Private Access Modifier:**\n",
    "   - In Python, members with a name that starts with double underscores (e.g., `__private_var`) are considered private by convention. This means they are intended to be treated as private and not accessed from outside the class. However, they can still be accessed if you know the name mangling convention (e.g., `_ClassName__private_var`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.__private_var = 20\n",
    "       \n",
    "   obj = MyClass()\n",
    "   print(obj.__private_var)  # Not recommended, but technically possible\n",
    "   print(obj._MyClass__private_var)  # Name mangling to access\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Protected Access Modifier:**\n",
    "   - In Python, the \"protected\" modifier is indicated by a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_protected_var`). By convention, this suggests that the member should not be accessed from outside the class, but it does not enforce this restriction.\n",
    "   - The protected member is intended to be accessed by subclasses and other classes, but it is not enforced by the language itself. It relies on developers following the convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyClass:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self._protected_var = 30\n",
    "       \n",
    "   class Derived(MyClass):\n",
    "       def access_protected(self):\n",
    "           print(self._protected_var)  # Accessible by convention\n",
    "   \n",
    "   obj = MyClass()\n",
    "   derived_obj = Derived()\n",
    "   print(obj._protected_var)  # Accessible from outside\n",
    "   derived_obj.access_protected()  # Accessing protected member from subclass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the \"protected\" access modifier in Python is a naming convention rather than a strict access control modifier. It suggests that a class member should be considered protected and not accessed from outside the class, but it does not prevent external access. Developers are expected to follow these conventions, but the language itself does not enforce access control in the same way as languages with stricter access control mechanisms.\n",

    "The \"super\" keyword in inheritance is used to call a method or access an attribute from the parent or superclass within a derived or child class. It provides a way to invoke the behavior of the superclass, which can be useful when you want to extend or override a method while retaining some or all of its original functionality. The \"super\" keyword is particularly important when you have overridden a method in a subclass and still want to execute the overridden method from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the purpose of the \"super\" keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calling Parent Class Methods:** You can use \"super\" to call methods defined in the parent class, allowing you to reuse and build upon the behavior of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialization:** In Python, \"super\" is often used to invoke the constructor of the parent class (base class) to perform any necessary initialization before extending it in the child class's constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Method Overriding:** If you override a method in a child class, you can still access and utilize the overridden method from the parent class by using \"super.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example in Python to illustrate the use of the \"super\" keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        super().__init(name)  # Call the parent class constructor\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def greet(self):\n",
    "        parent_greeting = super().greet()  # Call the parent class method\n",
    "        return f\"{parent_greeting} I am {self.age} years old.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create objects\n",
    "parent = Parent(\"Alice\")\n",
    "child = Child(\"Bob\", 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Call methods\n",
    "print(parent.greet())  # Output: \"Hello, I am Alice from the Parent class.\"\n",
    "print(child.greet())   # Output: \"Hello, I am Bob from the Parent class. I am 10 years old.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"super\" keyword is used in the `Child` class's constructor to call the constructor of the `Parent` class. This ensures that the parent class's initialization is carried out. In the `Child` class's `greet` method, \"super\" is used to call the `greet` method from the parent class and then extend the greeting with the child's age.\n",
    "\n",
